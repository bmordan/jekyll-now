## What? thats cool ðŸ§¸

* [Super Expressive](https://github.com/francisrstokes/super-expressive) is a JavaScript library that allows you to build regular expressions in almost natural language - with no extra dependencies, and a lightweight code footprint (less than 3kb with minification + gzip!).
* Nice blog post from one of the authors of Redux Dan Abramov (Facebook) [what the fork is a closure](https://whatthefork.is/closure). I love closures. Such a useful and secure programming pattern.
* [WebGazer.js](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/) is an eye tracking library that uses common webcams to infer the eye-gaze locations of web visitors on a page in real time.
