* PS5 launch ðŸ¤©.
* New version of VScode (v1.46). Pinned editor tabs, sync setting across devices! There are also some cool tips and tricks from the [Microsoft Build conference here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2020/BOD103?ocid=AID3012654&WT.mc_id=build2020-azuredevtips-micrum) with Matt Bierner.
* MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) builders and maintainers of Rust and the Firefox browser. They have a really awesome [Frontend web developer pathway](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer) that will support your frontend skills. I would encourage Richard's March Cohort to check these out ahead of your Microsoft Technical Associate exam!
